Q: What was this task trying to teach you?
A: This task taught me how responsive navigation bars work and why they are important for websites that are used on both desktop and mobiles.

Q: How did you design the navbar structure?
A: I used a header for the navbar, a nav tag to hold the links of the features, and a separate element for the hamburger icon for mobile view to keep the structure clean in HTML.

Q: How was responsiveness handled?
A: I used media queries to hide the navigation links on smaller screens and show the hamburger icon, while keeping the links visible on larger screens. Also I used the translate and text color change feature in navigation links in css when cursor is hovered over it.

Q: How does JavaScript control the menu?
A: JavaScript listens for a click on the hamburger icon and toggles a class that shows or hides the navigation menu.

Q: What did you learn from this task?
A: I learned how CSS and JavaScript work together and how class toggling and event listeners are used in real websites simultaneously.

Q: What is good about your solution and what could be improved?
A: The navbar works correctly on different screen sizes and the code is readable but the design and animations could be improved for the rest of the page with icons.

Q: Any difficulties or thoughts while working?
A: Understanding how CSS and JavaScript interact was confusing at first and I think I have to learn more.
