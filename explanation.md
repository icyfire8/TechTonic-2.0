For this task, I’ve used the Titanic dataset that I found on Kaggle.
I started with the shape attribute and head() function in pandas. The shape attribute returns the number of rows and columns in the dataset, while the head() function displays the first few rows of the data. Next, I used Seaborn to plot bar graphs, histograms, and one scatter plot.

Through those graphs and plots, I could come to a few conclusions:

There was a higher chance of females surviving as compared to males.

People aged from 20–30 had a much higher probability of surviving as compared to the older age groups.

Infants were prioritized more than toddlers.

The rate of survival is found to be the highest in the 1st class, followed by the 2nd class, and the least in the 3rd class.

The scatter plot is drawn between age and fare. The fare is on the y-axis and the age is on the x-axis. Many non-survivors are concentrated in the low-fare region. Passengers who paid higher fares had a higher chance of surviving.

The analysis showed a direct relation between class and the rate of survival, depicting the socio-economic behavior of our society.
